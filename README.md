# Craftz-Unleashed-Modded-Server

I am the owner and head developer of the Craftz Unleashed Minecraft server network, and here is the source code for all of the plugins and datapacks for the modded server. If you are a player, feel free to look around to see how everything works. If you would like these for your own server, feel free to build them yourself or download from the release. For easier future compatibility, I have not merged them into one plugin, so you will need all the plugins separately.
